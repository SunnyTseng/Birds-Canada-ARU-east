### Dec 15, 2023

-   Data processing, organizing

-   All the recordings were put at the same folder

-   Organize recordings by ARU - found the \# doesn't fit the list on excel

-   Organize recordings by site, by ARU

-   There are some "un-categorized" recordings:

    -   ARU #6, date from 20200604 - 20200715

    -   ARU #11, date from 20190527 - 20190703

    -   ARU #12, date from 20190527 - 20190705

    -   ARU #16, date from 20170709 - 20170713

    -   ARU #25, date from 20200604 - 20200626

-   Questions:

    -   Holden Meadow only have 5 days of data instead of 10

-   Processed 3 sites, and got contacted by Birds Canada as the contract budget is not approved - stopped working on this project at the moment
