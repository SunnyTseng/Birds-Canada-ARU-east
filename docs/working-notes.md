- Data processing, organizing

- All the recordings were put at the same folder

- Organize recordings by ARU - found the \# doesn’t fit the list on
  excel

- Organize recordings by site, by ARU

- There are some “un-categorized” recordings (can’t set the location):

  - ARU \#6, date from 20200604 - 20200715

  - ARU \#11, date from 20190527 - 20190703

  - ARU \#12, date from 20190527 - 20190705

  - ARU \#16, date from 20170709 - 20170713

  - ARU \#25, date from 20200604 - 20200626

- Questions:

  - Holden Meadow only have 5 days of data instead of 10
  - There are some data can’t be opened! The data was damaged

- Processed 3 sites, and got contacted by Birds Canada as the contract
  budget is not approved - stopped working on this project at the moment

### Dec. 18, 2023

- Next steps:

  - Finish running the rest of the recordings, site by site (need the
    location)

  - Communicate the questions with Ghram

  - Combine output from each site, each ARU

## Jan. 03, 2024
